check read me file please 

This project isn't finished yet, and there are a lot of mistakes in the code, like in the error handling. I know whyâ€”because I'm an idiot. Anyway, this is my second time trying to do this project. I'm using callback functions this time, and I borrowed some of the code from this repo: https://github.com/sphaerophoria/ball-machine/commit/fb995b3db2ae66eccde001dd25577479346e157e. Do you know why I steal ( i mean borrow)  some code from this repo? Because I'm a bad programmer, and I'll be replaced by AI (god i hope not!).

Check out the channel of the guy whose code I borrowed. His channel name is sphaerophoria, and he definitely won't replace by ai.
